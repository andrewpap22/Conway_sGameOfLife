------------------------- Conway's Game of Life in C ---------------------------

    You can cause the program to output the Game of Life grid at each time step
by uncommenting the relevant line in the Makefile.

    The code can be made into serial, MPI, OpenMP, and hybrid executables. To
compile each of these, enter 'make serial', 'make mpi', 'make openmp', or
'make hybrid', respectively.  To remove all executables from the directory,
enter 'make clean'.  To re-make all of the executables at once, enter 'make
all'.
